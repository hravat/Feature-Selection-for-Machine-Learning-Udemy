    "\n",
    "Quasi-constant features are those that show the same value for the great majority of the observations of the dataset. In general, these features provide little, if any, information that allows a machine learning model to discriminate or predict a target. But there can be exceptions. So you should be careful when removing these type of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying and removing quasi-constant features, is an easy first step towards feature selection and more interpretable machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify quasi-constant features, we can use the VarianceThreshold from Scikit-learn, or we can code it ourselves. If we use the VarianceThreshold, all our variables need to be numerical. If we code it manually however, we can apply the code to both numerical and categorical variables.\n"
